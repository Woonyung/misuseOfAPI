* This project starts from the assignment for the class, [Appropriating Interaction Technology](https://github.com/lmccart/AppropriatingInteractionTechnologies)–taught by Kyle McDonald and Lauren McCarthy and [Data Art](https://github.com/blprnt/dataart)– taught by Jer Thorp.

* Each of dots are color coded – a place which has the least like counts starts from white (0 likes counts) and  goes to green, yellow —> and eventually for a place which has more like counts is coded as red dot. This web does not suggest the places which have more than 30 like counts.

* Since I am using Foursquare API, I borrowed Foursquare-like color scheme in Adobe Kuler.

* Actual project can be seen [here](http://woonyungchoi.com/AIT/week2/):kissing::kissing:

##Features that I want to fix more:

* pop up window that will tell - how this app works (with x button)
* combining with restaurant rating data (A, B, etc)
* adding photos of that specific places(?)

* (maybe on the future) working on direction API from Google, so that users can pick their destination and it will give users “user-friendly direction” to get there. I have tried with parsing Google direction API, but for some reasons, Google does not allow me to use jquery’s ajax request. I have to figure out another way for doing this.
