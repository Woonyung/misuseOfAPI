## I will suggest places that no one likes


[ work-in-progress]

* This project is for the assignment for the class, [Appropriating Interaction Technology](https://github.com/lmccart/AppropriatingInteractionTechnologies), taught by Kyle McDonald and Lauren McCarthy


* Actual project can be seen [here](http://woonyungchoi.com/AIT/week2/).

* Each of dots are color coded – a place which has the least like counts starts from white (0 likes counts) and  goes to green, yellow —> and eventually for a place which has more like counts is coded as red dot. This web does not suggest the places which have more than 30 like counts.

* Since I am using Foursquare API, I borrowed Foursquare-like color scheme in Adobe Kuler.


##Features that I want to fix more:

* Clearing out the map, whenever user click the submit button again on the same page.
* Change layout for better user experience - with step by step instruction?

* (maybe on the future) working on direction API from Google, so that users can pick their destination and it will give users “user-friendly direction” to get there. I have tried with parsing Google direction API, but for some reasons, Google does not allow me to use jquery’s ajax request. I have to figure out another way for doing this.
